        <p> the schedule's been very tight lately </p>
        <p> olympic English is pretty much approaching at an unprecedented pace </p>

        <p> it is only 10 days left before the olympic English competition</p>

        <p> the test was rather unusually easy</p>
        <p> i was happy at first because i did the test very well, but it turned into great concern for quite an obvious reason </p>
        <p> due to the test being easy, marks will skyrocket</p>
        <p> this can have serious effects on my chance to win a prize </p>
        <p> the olympic takes percentages of the number of participants to award them prizes, and so high marks will lead to high prizes standard </p>
        <p> like usually you only need about 15/20 to get the second prize, 
            but because of the "score inflation", a 17/20 may not even be enough for a third prize</p>
        <p> this fact has troubled me a lot since the test day</p>
        <div class = "heading" id = "on-tenterhooks"> day 10 (15/4/2024): uneasiness</div>
        <p> the city is painfully slow in grading the olympic tests</p>
        <p> i've been restless and feeling uneasy, trying to look up the test scores to no avail</p>
        <p> they only needed the afternoon following the olympic to grade the tests for the gifted schools </p>
        <p> but they needed at least 9 days to do the same for the non-gifted schools?</p>
        <p> is there actually a single thing hindering their progress?</p>
