        <h3> watch as this thing grows like a tree from a sprout, slowly but worth it at the end</h3>
        <p> i've been dreaming of becoming a renowned game developer for 3 years, and i've been studying a lot for that</p>
        <p> first i started off by studying a game making course for a year, which granted me great proficiency in GMS2</p>
        <p> now i'm trying to tackle web development, which has proven to be very difficult</p>
        <div class = "heading" id = "info">
            some informations
        </div>
        <div class = "subheading">
            about myself
        </div>
        <p> i'm vexi, a 17-year-old kid from Vietnam</p>
        <p> i've always dreamed of becoming a game developer</p>
        <div class = "heading" id = "first day"> day 1 (4/2/2023): adding some basic text elements</div>

        <b><p style="color: green;"> i can solve lots of integrals, my ability has existed since grade 10 </p></b>
        <pre> "those lessons about statistics and probability are ridiculous, now get ready for real lessons:

        <div class = "heading" id = "second day"> day 2 (11/2/2023): just changed the background color, starting to use fonts too</div>

        <p><b> still don't have enough money to finally return to my hometown after 6 years, but that doesn't make the Tet less fun </b></p>
        <p><b> guess we're gonna wait for 5 more years or so</b></p>
        <div class = "heading" id = "third day"> day 3 (2/3/2023): added a table in which i review some recent games i've played </div>
